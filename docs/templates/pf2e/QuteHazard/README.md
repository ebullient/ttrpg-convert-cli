# QuteHazard

Pf2eTools Hazard attributes (`hazard2md.txt`)

Hazards are rendered both standalone and inline (as an admonition block).
The default template can render both.
It uses special syntax to handle the inline case.

Use `%%--` to mark the end of the preamble (frontmatter and
other leading content only appropriate to the standalone case).

Extension of [Pf2eQuteBase](../Pf2eQuteBase.md)
