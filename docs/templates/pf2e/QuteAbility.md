# QuteAbility

Pf2eTools Ability attributes (`ability2md.txt` or `inline-ability2md.txt`).

Abilities are rendered both standalone and inline (as an admonition block).
The default template can render both. It contains some special syntax to handle
the inline case.

Use `%%--` to mark the end of the preamble (frontmatter and
other leading content only appropriate to the standalone case).

Extension of [Pf2eQuteNote](Pf2eQuteNote.md)
