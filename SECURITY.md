# Security Policy

I only support the latest version of the CLI. Given changes to source data, running/maintaining older versions isn't feasible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security issues privately using GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” link in the repository sidebar.

Do **not** open a public issue for suspected vulnerabilities.

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the issue and affected versions
- Steps to reproduce (ideally a minimal proof-of-concept)
- Assessment of potential impact
- Your contact information
- Any specific requests, such as anonymity for you and/or the organization you represent
