        "Mind Lock is a kind of psychic manipulation that renders inaccessible to any but the Psion a portion of the target's mind. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw to avoid this effect. If the saving throw fails, the wipe has been successful, making the knowledge in that part of the target's mind inaccessible, and reducing the target's intelligence and Wisdom scores by 1 point each. This can affect everything from languages known, to spells which may be cast. This memory loss is permanent unless restored by the Psion or through a wish or similar spell. This ability may cumulatively affect a target down to a minimum intelligence or Wisdom score of 3.
